# Objective 1 - Implementation and Code Sharing [5 Marks]

## Task 1: Refactoring with OOP and Functional Programming Principles

In Assignment I, our codebase was a flat `app/` folder with all logic residing in a single `pipeline.py` file. For Assignment II, we refactored the entire codebase into a well-structured Python package `loan_risk` following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Each module now handles exactly one concern:

| Module | Responsibility | Key Class/Function |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `data/ingestion.py` | Data loading and I/O isolation | `DataIngestor` |
| `data/validation.py` | Schema validation and data quality checks | `DataValidator` |
| `features/engineering.py` | Feature derivation and transformation | `FeatureEngineer` |
| `models/trainer.py` | Model training, evaluation, and persistence | `ModelTrainer` |
| `models/predictor.py` | Inference pipeline with pipe-and-filter pattern | `RiskPredictor` |
| `api/app.py` | REST API serving | FastAPI application |
| `config.py` | Externalized configuration management | `Settings` (frozen dataclass) |
| `logging_utils.py` | Structured JSON logging | `JsonFormatter`, `get_logger()` |
| `exceptions.py` | Domain-specific exception hierarchy | `LoanRiskError` base class |

**OOP Principles Applied:**
- **Encapsulation:** Each class hides its internal state and exposes only a well-defined interface (e.g., `DataIngestor.load()` hides CSV parsing details).
- **Single Responsibility:** Each module/class handles exactly one concern.
- **Open/Closed Principle:** New algorithms can be added to `ModelTrainer.build_pipeline()` without modifying existing code paths.

**Functional Programming Principles Applied:**
- **Pure Functions:** `safe_ratio()`, `compute_loan_to_income()`, `compute_savings_to_loan()` have no side effects and are independently testable.
- **Immutability:** Configuration objects are frozen dataclasses that cannot be modified after creation.

Below are the complete source files demonstrating these principles:

### File: `src/loan_risk/config.py`

This module implements the **configuration management** layer using frozen (immutable) dataclasses. By externalizing all tunable parameters (hyperparameters, quality gates, business rules) into a YAML file and loading them into typed, immutable objects, we address Sculley et al.'s "configuration debt" anti-pattern. No magic numbers exist anywhere in the codebase - every threshold is traceable to this configuration.

**OOP Concepts Used:** Frozen `@dataclass` for immutability, composition (Settings aggregates ModelConfig, QualityGates, BusinessRules), factory function pattern (`load_settings()`).

### File: `src/loan_risk/exceptions.py`

This module defines a **domain-specific exception hierarchy** with `LoanRiskError` as the root. Each exception class maps to a distinct failure mode in our system. This design allows the API layer to catch domain exceptions and translate them into appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., `BusinessRuleViolation` -> 400, `ModelNotLoadedError` -> 503) rather than exposing raw Python exceptions as 500 Internal Server Errors.

**OOP Concepts Used:** Inheritance hierarchy, polymorphism (each exception carries context-specific data like `SchemaValidationError.violations`).

### File: `src/loan_risk/data/ingestion.py`

This module implements the **DataIngestor** class, which is the single point of contact with the filesystem for training data. By isolating all I/O operations behind one class, the rest of the pipeline can be unit-tested using in-memory DataFrames without touching the disk. If we later migrate from CSV files to a feature store or database, only this single file needs to change.

**OOP Concepts Used:** Encapsulation of I/O concerns, dependency injection (accepts `Settings` via constructor), fail-fast validation (checks file existence, empty data, missing columns before proceeding).

### File: `src/loan_risk/features/engineering.py`

This module is the **production counterpart** of the research notebook (see Task 2). It combines both OOP and functional programming approaches:

- **Functional:** `safe_ratio()`, `compute_loan_to_income()`, and `compute_savings_to_loan()` are pure functions with no side effects, making them straightforward to unit test and reason about.
- **OOP:** `FeatureEngineer` implements scikit-learn's `BaseEstimator` and `TransformerMixin` interfaces, allowing it to be serialized inside a `Pipeline` object. This ensures the exact same transformation logic is applied during both training and inference, structurally preventing training/serving skew.

The `FEATURE_ORDER` contract guarantees that columns are always produced in an identical order regardless of input column ordering.

### File: `src/loan_risk/models/trainer.py`

This module implements the **ModelTrainer** class, which owns the complete model lifecycle: building the pipeline, training, evaluating on a held-out set, enforcing quality gates, and persisting the artifact to disk.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- The sklearn `Pipeline` embeds `FeatureEngineer` as its first stage, so the serialized model artifact contains the feature transformation logic. This structurally prevents training/serving skew.
- Quality gates are enforced programmatically after training. If any metric falls below the configured threshold, the build fails with a clear error rather than silently deploying a degraded model.
- `ModelMetrics` is a dataclass that holds the complete evaluation suite and can be serialized to JSON for reporting.

**OOP Concepts Used:** Encapsulation (pipeline state managed internally), Template Method pattern (train -> evaluate -> gate -> save), composition with `FeatureEngineer`.

### File: `src/loan_risk/models/predictor.py`

This module implements the **inference component** using two classes:

1. **ModelRegistry** - Responsible for loading and holding the serialized pipeline artifact. It provides a clean separation between artifact management and scoring logic.
2. **RiskPredictor** - Implements a **pipe-and-filter** architectural pattern with four sequential filters:
   - Filter 1: `validate_business_rules()` - Applies underwriting policy constraints
   - Filter 2: `to_frame()` - Converts the input payload to a model-compatible DataFrame
   - Filter 3: `score()` - Obtains the probability from the trained estimator
   - Filter 4: `assign_risk_tier()` - Maps the probability to a business-meaningful risk tier (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)

**OOP Concepts Used:** Separation of concerns (registry vs. predictor), frozen dataclass for value objects (`RiskAssessment`), dependency injection (predictor receives registry via constructor).

## Task 3: Error Handling and Logging

We implemented structured error handling and logging across the entire application using Python's built-in `logging` module with a custom JSON formatter. This approach ensures that all log events are machine-parseable (suitable for log aggregation tools like ELK, CloudWatch, or Splunk) while remaining human-readable during development.

**Log Level Policy (applied consistently across all modules):**
- **INFO** - Normal lifecycle events worth auditing (e.g., data loaded successfully, model trained, prediction served)
- **WARNING** - Recoverable anomalies where the system continues but an operator should be aware (e.g., soft data-quality breach, business rule rejection)
- **ERROR** - The operation has failed and the caller will receive an error response (e.g., file not found, training crashed, model unavailable)

We demonstrate error handling and logging across **3 critical functions** as required by the assignment.

## Task 5: REST API Design and Implementation

We implemented a RESTful API using **FastAPI** to serve the trained model for real-time inference. The API follows industry best practices for ML model serving:

**Endpoints:**

| GET | `/health` | Liveness/readiness probe for orchestrators | 200 |
| POST | `/v1/predict` | Score a single loan application | 200, 400, 422, 503 |

**Design Principles:**
- **Versioned paths** (`/v1/`) allow breaking changes to ship as `/v2/` without affecting existing consumers
- **Bounded Pydantic schemas** reject invalid inputs at the API boundary (HTTP 422) before they reach the model
- **Differentiated status codes** communicate the nature of the failure (400 = business rule, 422 = schema, 503 = model unavailable)
- **Domain exception handlers** translate internal errors to safe HTTP responses without leaking stack traces

- **Unit tests** form the base of the testing pyramid. They run in milliseconds and give precise, localized failure signals when a function's contract is broken.
- **Integration tests** sit at the top of the pyramid. They verify that all components (API routing, schema validation, model registry, feature engineering, inference) work correctly when wired together through the real HTTP surface.

### File: `tests/conftest.py` (Shared Fixtures)

This file contains the shared pytest fixtures that both test types depend on. All test artifacts are built **in memory** (synthetic DataFrames, a trained pipeline, a FastAPI TestClient with a primed model registry), so the entire test suite runs in under 2 seconds on a clean checkout without requiring a pre-trained model file on disk. This is a hard requirement for running tests in CI/CD pipelines.

### File: `tests/test_unit_features.py` (Test Type 1: Unit Tests - 5 tests)

Unit tests validate individual functions and classes **in isolation**, with no disk I/O, no trained model, and no network calls. They form the fastest layer of the testing pyramid and make refactoring safe by catching regressions immediately.

**Tests implemented:**
1. `test_safe_ratio_never_divides_by_zero` - Verifies the +1 smoothing prevents ZeroDivisionError
2. `test_safe_ratio_produces_correct_value_for_normal_inputs` - Verifies the mathematical correctness of the ratio computation
3. `test_compute_loan_to_income_returns_expected_value` - Verifies the leverage ratio helper produces expected output
4. `test_transformer_emits_the_declared_feature_contract` - Verifies FeatureEngineer outputs exactly the declared columns in correct order
5. `test_feature_engineer_rejects_non_dataframe_input` - Verifies type validation raises FeatureEngineeringError for invalid inputs

### File: `tests/test_integration_api.py` (Test Type 2: Integration Tests - 5 tests)

Integration tests exercise **multiple components working together** through the actual HTTP interface. While unit tests prove individual parts work, integration tests prove the parts are wired together correctly. Each test makes a real HTTP request through FastAPI's TestClient and verifies the complete response.

**Tests implemented:**
1. `test_health_endpoint_reports_a_loaded_model` - GET /health returns 200 with model status
2. `test_predict_returns_200_and_a_complete_payload` - Valid application returns all expected response fields
3. `test_predict_rejects_out_of_range_credit_score_with_422` - Schema violation returns HTTP 422
4. `test_predict_rejects_overleveraged_application_with_400` - Business rule violation returns HTTP 400

### File: `src/loan_risk/data/validation.py`

This module implements the data quality gate. It declares a schema contract (`LOAN_SCHEMA`) as a tuple of `ColumnSpec` objects, each specifying the column name, expected data type, valid minimum/maximum, and nullability. The `DataValidator` class checks every column against this contract and produces a `DataQualityReport` containing both metrics. In strict mode, any violation halts the pipeline.

## Task 9: Production Testing and Security Consideration

### 9a. Production Testing Approach: Shadow Deployment followed by Canary Release

For a credit-risk model, the true label (whether the borrower actually defaulted) only becomes available months after the prediction is made. This means we cannot rely on traditional A/B testing with immediate outcome measurement. Instead, we propose a two-stage deployment strategy:

**Stage 1 - Shadow Deployment (2 weeks minimum):**
- The new model scores every live request **alongside** the current production model
- Only the production model's answer is returned to the customer
- We compare: score distributions, disagreement rate between old/new models, and inference latency
- **Risk: Zero** - the new model's predictions are never served to actual users

**Stage 2 - Canary Release (graduated rollout):**
- Traffic is gradually shifted to the new model: 5% -> 25% -> 50% -> 100%
- At each step we monitor: approval rate, error rate, p99 latency
- Each step is held for at least 48 hours before proceeding
- **Automatic rollback** is triggered if any KPI breaches its control limit

This approach ensures that model quality is validated against real production traffic before full deployment, while maintaining zero risk to customers during the shadow phase.

### 9b. Security Consideration: Input Validation Against Adversarial Inputs

Since the scoring endpoint is accessible from a customer-facing portal, the primary security threat is **adversarial input** - malicious users attempting to manipulate the model's predictions or exploit the API.

**Mitigations implemented in our codebase:**

| # | Mitigation | Implementation | Effect |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | Bounded field constraints | All 20 fields have `ge`/`le` validators in Pydantic schema | Out-of-domain values rejected with HTTP 422 before reaching model |
| 2 | Strict type coercion | Pydantic enforces numeric types | SQL injection or code injection strings fail parsing |
| 3 | Unknown field rejection | `extra="forbid"` in model config | Unknown keys rejected, preventing parameter-pollution attacks |
| 4 | Business-rule filter | `RiskPredictor.validate_business_rules()` | Semantically absurd but schema-valid combinations caught (e.g., loan > 5x income -> HTTP 400) |
| 5 | Opaque error responses | Exception handlers return generic messages | No stack traces, file paths, or internal module names leaked to clients |
