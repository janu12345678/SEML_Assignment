"""TEST TYPE 3 - ML BEHAVIOURAL TESTS: MODEL TRAINING (Objective 2.7a).

Ordinary unit tests cannot tell you whether *learning* actually happened. The
canonical ML training tests are implemented here:

  * overfit-a-small-batch  -- if the model cannot memorise 40 rows, the wiring
                              between features, labels and estimator is broken;
  * loss-decreases         -- log-loss must fall as capacity/iterations grow;
  * reproducibility        -- a fixed seed must give a bit-identical model;
  * boundary: single-class -- degenerate labels must raise, not silently fit;
  * boundary: tiny dataset -- model must still train on minimal viable rows.
